hot reload

Flutter offers a fast development cycle with Stateful Hot Reload, the ability to reload the code of a live running app 
without restarting or losing app state. Make a change to app source, tell your IDE or command-line tool that you want to hot reload,
and see the change in your simulator, emulator, or device.
