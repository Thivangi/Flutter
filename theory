hot reload

Flutter offers a fast development cycle with Stateful Hot Reload, the ability to reload the code of a live running app 
without restarting or losing app state. Make a change to app source, tell your IDE or command-line tool that you want to hot reload,
and see the change in your simulator, emulator, or device.



introdution to widgets
Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes inspiration from React. 
The central idea is that you build your UI out of widgets. 
Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. 
When a widgetâ€™s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework diffs against the previous description in
order to determine the minimal changes needed inthe underlying render tree to transition from one state to the next.
